This video can be played on any browser that supports the HLS protocol. Amazon Elastic Transcoder will take on the role of converting the original video into a format suitable for distribution to users, in this case, HLS.\nAfter completing the workshop, the architecture is as follows: Architecture Description The architecture of the workshop is built using three AWS services: Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon Elastic Transcoder:\nS3 bucket input stores the original video. Amazon Elastic Transcoder converts the video into HLS format. After being converted, the video is stored in the S3 bucket output. Amazon CloudFront distributes the output video to user devices.

	"content": "Overview Amazon Elastic Transcoder is a service that enables the conversion of digital media stored in Amazon S3 into the formats required for user playback devices.\nElastic Transcoder has three components:\nPipeline are queues that manage format conversion jobs. Elastic Transcoder processes jobs in the order they are added to a pipeline. Typically, you need to create at least two pipelines: one for standard priority jobs and one for high priority jobs. Most jobs will be submitted to the standard priority pipeline, only using the high priority pipeline when immediate format conversion is needed.\nJob specifies settings not included in the preset, such as the file to be converted and whether to create thumbnails. Each job converts a file into a different format. When creating a job, Elastic Transcoder will add it to the specified pipeline. If there are other jobs already in the pipeline, the new job will have to wait and start processing when resources become available.\nPreset are templates that define most of the settings for the converted file. Elastic Transcoder includes several default presets for common formats. Users can create their own presets. When creating a job, you need to specify which preset will be used.\nContent Create Pipeline Create Job "
